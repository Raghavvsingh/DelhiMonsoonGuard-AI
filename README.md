## Mapping Water-Logging Hotspots & Monsoon Preparedness of Delhi

DelhiMonsoonGuard is a **data-driven, GIS-enabled platform** designed to **identify and map water-logging hotspots across Delhi** and **assess monsoon preparedness at the ward level**.  
The project supports **proactive urban planning and early response** by municipal authorities during the monsoon season.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Delhi faces recurring **water-logging during monsoons**, leading to:
- Traffic disruption and commuter delays
- Damage to roads and urban infrastructure
- Public inconvenience and safety risks

Current approaches are largely **reactive**, lack **ward-level preparedness assessment**, and underutilize available spatial and environmental data.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

DelhiMonsoonGuard transforms fragmented urban data into **predictive, actionable insights** by:

- Mapping **water-logging hotspots using GIS**
- Predicting **ward-level flood risk (Low / Medium / High)**
- Computing a **Monsoon Preparedness Score** for each ward
- Providing **decision-ready dashboards** for authorities

> From static flood maps → to predictive preparedness intelligence
